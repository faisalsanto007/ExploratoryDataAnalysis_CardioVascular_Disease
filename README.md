# EDA_CardioVascular_Disease
 
In this project, I've tried to visually represent each feature to understand if the feature itself is somehow related to disease. There were some outliers in the dataset so we needed to get rid of them. Also, there were some inconsistencies in the dataset, so we fixed them. We created some plots and were able to find some relation of having cardio disease.
